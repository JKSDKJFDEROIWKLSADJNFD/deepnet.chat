[+] DOCUMENTATION FOR VERSION 1.0 !

In the spirit of keeping it oldschool, I decided to do the
documentation in a text file. I hope this is not an issue.
One of the main reasons why I love python is its simplicity.
There are only a few lines of code and they work perfectly.

The chat at this stage allows for users to send messages, but
only if they take turns. Future versions might be better. I
have used ROT13 because I thought it was more fun than 
implementing military-grade, quantum-proof encryption.

I work as a penetration tester and write scripts all the time.
I'm really not a programmer. Thats a big reason why I dont do gui!

[+] HOW TO USE?

server@home~/python server.py [localhost] [port]
client@work~/python client.py [ Home IP ] [port] 

1) Start server.py in terminal eg.(python server.py localhost 6666).
2) Choose nickname and wait.

1) Start client.py in terminal eg.(python client.py localhost 6666).
2) Choose a nickname and send a message!

3) Start chatting you guys!

4) When done, press Ctrl+C to abort the program.


[+] DEPENDENCIES? COMPILERS? EXECUTABLES? GARBAGE COLLECTORS?

Nah. All you need is python. I only used native libraries for
maximum versatility. Hope you enjoy.
